<h1>Reef</h1>

<strong>Proof-bound agent underwriting on Mantle — transaction risk, evidence, and capital gates you can check on-chain.</strong>

Reef is a prototype risk and authorization layer for autonomous financial agents: portable ERC-8004 identity, evidence-envelope receipts, realized-PnL reputation, transaction policy checks, Safe transaction enforcement, and a public TrustOracle any Mantle protocol can read.

<p align="center"><em>Judge Mode turns one live agent decision into a 60-second proof path: model rationale, ReefGuard verdict, on-chain receipt, matched hash, TrustOracle score, and BYOA status.</em></p>

---

## Why Reef Exists

Reef answers one question: **should this autonomous agent be allowed to execute this financial action right now?**

Software agents can now hold and move money on their own, but wallets and protocols still need a non-bypassable risk check before capital moves. Reef is an **agent transaction safety and underwriting prototype**: every agent has a portable ERC-8004 identity, a sovereign vault, source-labelled decision records, strict-sequence EIP-712 evidence-envelope receipts, realized-PnL reputation, and policy gates that can block unsafe actions before execution. The current receipt proof is intentionally narrow: it proves the canonical envelope and rationale hash match what was stored on-chain. It does not yet prove model provenance, runtime integrity, data-source authenticity, or that the model caused the transaction.

Built for the **Mantle Turing Test Hackathon 2026 — AI × RWA track**.

## What It Does

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><strong>Composable TrustOracle</strong><br /><code>TrustOracle.scoreOf(agentId)</code> returns a prototype 0–100 Trust Score in one on-chain call: absolute-target reputation 40%, decision-time receipt freshness 20%, drawdown 20%, bond 20%, plus a T1-T5 risk tier. It is a demo risk score, not a production credit rating.</td>
<td width="50%"><strong>Policy and capital gating</strong><br /><code>ReefGuard.canExecuteAction(...)</code> derives size from native/ERC-20 transaction data, checks registration, bond, disputes, asset allowlist, optional TrustOracle score, and max size. <code>canExecute</code> remains for legacy size-bps integrations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><strong>Proof-bound decision loop</strong><br />Reference agents read Allora predictions, Nansen smart-money flow, CoinGecko momentum, and vault NAV, then decide via Z.ai GLM or an explicit deterministic fallback. The receipt binds a canonical evidence envelope on-chain; model/runtime attestation is future work.</td>
<td width="50%"><strong>Bring your own agent</strong><br /><code>create-reef-agent</code> plus the zero-dependency <code>@reef/sdk</code> let any builder register an ERC-8004 identity, post a bond, self-list into the index, and run the proof-bound receipt loop. Agent 6 is live through this path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><strong>RWA-aware compliance</strong><br /><code>ComplianceRegistry.screen(address)</code> provides KYC, accreditation, and ISO-3166 jurisdiction attestations. The app soft-gates deposits, and the AI screener writes verdict evidence hashes on-chain.</td>
<td width="50%"><strong>Mantle-native yield proof</strong><br />Reef includes a live Mantle-mainnet mETH custody proof and a FusionX-backed benchmark. The mETH vault is demo-scale and paused, but the custody, NAV mark, and contract verification are real.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Reef Labs surfaces kept for evaluation and demos: A2A signal market, Human-vs-AI seasons, reputation-weighted rINDEX, automated risk management, mainnet benchmark, proof page, and agent passport pages. The core wedge is transaction authorization and underwriting.

## See It In Action

![Reef landing - live index telemetry](docs/landing.png)

The landing page frames Reef as verifiable AI yield agents on Mantle and keeps the live rINDEX telemetry visible in the first viewport.

![On-chain proof - every contract verified](docs/transparency.png)

The transparency page exposes verified contracts, TrustOracle parity, receipt proofs, mainnet RWA custody, and the Financial Turing Test benchmark from live feeds.

![Reef Judge Mode - dark mode](docs/judge-mode-dark.png)

Dark mode preserves the same proof path and keeps the live decision trace readable for demos, recordings, and judge review.

## Verify it yourself

Current source uses v2 evidence-envelope receipts: `evidenceHash = keccak256(canonical evidence envelope)`. The envelope carries the rationale hash plus agent/vault identity, decision timestamp, validity window, action context, policy result, execution context, post-state, outcome context, and content-addressed evidence URI hash. The verifier checks both the envelope hash against `AgentVault.lastReceiptEvidenceHash` and `keccak256(rationale)` against the envelope's `rationaleHash`.

Reef commits each matched decision on-chain as `evidenceHash = keccak256(canonical evidence envelope)`. You don't have to trust the dashboard for that narrow claim — recompute it. This read-only check (no keys, no clone state) pulls the published envelopes from `/api/proofs.json`, recomputes the hash, and matches it against each vault's on-chain `AgentVault.lastReceiptEvidenceHash`:

```bash
python -m agents.scripts.verify_proof
```

```text
agent 1: OK - envelope==evidence==on-chain 0xe826d948...745e8d80; rationale=0x...
...
5 matched proof(s) verified, 0 liveness-only, 0 failed
REEF_PROOF_VALID
```

Three independent checks per agent: the recomputed envelope hash equals the published `evidenceHash`, the on-chain `lastReceiptEvidenceHash` equals that evidence hash, and `keccak256(rationale)` equals the envelope's `rationaleHash`. This is evidence-envelope integrity, not proof that a specific model binary produced the rationale. The same proof renders in the browser on the [proof page](https://reef.gudman.xyz/transparency).

The homepage policy veto is also backed by a read-only contract result. `guard_snapshot` calls the live Sepolia `ReefGuard.canExecute(agentId, asset, sizeBps)` twice: once at the approved check size for each agent, and once with an oversized proposal that should return `allowed=false` and the exact policy reason. The result is published as the `blockedAction` field in `/api/guard.json`; no transaction or private key is involved.

```bash
API_OUT_DIR=ui/api python -m agents.scripts.guard_snapshot
API_OUT_DIR=ui/api python -m agents.scripts.veto_proof_snapshot

## Live deployments

Everything is on-chain and verifiable — the source of truth is [`deployments/`](deployments/), and every contract is Mantlescan-verified.

**Mantle Sepolia (chain 5003)** — full system seeded: 5 agent vaults, the reputation-weighted index, bond gate, open season, `TrustOracle`, `ReefGuard`, both `Allocator`s, and the A2A market. VPS crons run reference agents, source-labelled decisions, rationale-bound/cadence receipts, read-only snapshots, and some agent-level FusionX swap proofs. This is not evidence of independent profitable asset management. All addresses in [`deployments/mantle-sepolia.json`](deployments/mantle-sepolia.json).

**Mantle Mainnet (chain 5000) — real mETH RWA vault.** A vault custodying real **mETH** (Mantle's liquid-staked ETH). Because mETH is non-rebasing (yield accrues in the mETH→ETH rate maintained on L1), `MethRateAdapter` marks the held mETH to ETH via an on-chain `MethRate` store, so the vault's `nav()` reflects **real staking yield**. All 6 contracts Mantlescan-verified; addresses in [`deployments/mantle-mainnet.json`](deployments/mantle-mainnet.json):

| Contract          | Address                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AgentVault (mETH) | [`0x76f129…cFA5`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0x76f129D56a4BE538f7E3bd44DAC70b23BcDFcFA5)   |
| MethRateAdapter   | [`0xb7Ceedf6…a90A`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0xb7Ceedf6BDC4Cf8bdBE8610EAe1D1f962E35a90A) |
| MethRate          | [`0xf765d02A…6b4E`](https://mantlescan.xyz/address/0xf765d02A7F04bFDB8f72d97D5584d80475dF6b4E) |

> The mainnet position is **demo scale** and the code is **unaudited** — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) before any real TVL.

A second mainnet deployment runs the **Financial Turing Test as a live benchmark**: four AI agents (GLM Synthesis, Momentum, Contrarian, HODL) take real USDC↔WMNT positions through FusionX V2 and are scored by risk-adjusted return against the human HODL baseline. All addresses (Mantlescan-verified) are in [`deployments/mantle-mainnet.json`](deployments/mantle-mainnet.json) under `benchmark`; results render on `/transparency`.

## Tech stack

- **Contracts** — Solidity 0.8.24, Foundry 1.7.1 (`evm_version = paris`); unit + fuzz/invariant suites + live mainnet-fork tests. **263 tests passing, 1 skipped**.
- **Agents** — Python (web3.py) reference agents, keeper, receipt loop, and read-only snapshots in `agents/`; decisions via Z.ai GLM with a deterministic fallback.
- **Frontend** — static, no build step (`ui/`): `index.html` (landing), `app.html` (dashboard), `transparency.html` (on-chain proof), `agent.html` (agent passport), with a site-wide light/dark theme (light default), served at [reef.gudman.xyz](https://reef.gudman.xyz).
- **SDK** — `@reef/sdk` (`sdk/`), a zero-dependency JS/TS client.

## Quickstart

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ridwannurudeen/reef.git
cd reef
cp .env.example .env     # fill in PRIVATE_KEY + API keys (all optional for build/test)
forge build
forge test                # 263 passing, 1 skipped
```

The static site needs no build — open `ui/index.html`.

### Try it without installing

Open [reef.gudman.xyz/app](https://reef.gudman.xyz/app) for the dashboard, or [reef.gudman.xyz/transparency](https://reef.gudman.xyz/transparency) for the proof page. The strongest read-only proof path is: open `/transparency`, pick a matched proof, then compare the published `evidenceHash` against the vault's `lastReceiptEvidenceHash` on Mantlescan.

### Use the live feeds directly

```bash
curl https://reef.gudman.xyz/api/proofs.json
curl https://reef.gudman.xyz/api/proofbound.json

## Build on Reef

Reef is infrastructure other Mantle protocols call — read an agent's trust, or gate an action behind on-chain policy. See [`INTEGRATION.md`](INTEGRATION.md).

**Solidity** — read the score, or gate with one modifier:

```solidity
uint256 score = ITrustOracle(oracle).scoreOf(agentId);   // 1e18 == 100/100
// or inherit ReefGuarded and gate an entrypoint:
function act(uint256 id, address asset, uint256 sizeBps)
    external onlyCleared(id, asset, sizeBps) { /* reverts with the policy reason if not cleared */ }
```

**JS / TS** — `@reef/sdk`, zero dependencies:

```js
import { ReefClient } from "@reef/sdk";
const reef = new ReefClient({ rpcUrl, oracleAddress, guardAddress, apiBase });
await reef.trustScoreOf(5); // 99.9
await reef.report(5, asset, 1000); // { score, rating, guardCleared, guardReason }
```

Live reference integrations (Mantlescan-verified): `MockProtocol` (ReefGuard gate) and `TrustOracleConsumer` (trust-weighted credit). New integrations should prefer `canExecuteAction` where ReefGuard derives action size from native/ERC-20 calldata; `canExecute(agentId, asset, sizeBps)` remains for older integrations that already compute size internally.

**Bring your own agent** — `create-reef-agent/` is a fork-ready scaffold that registers an ERC-8004 identity, posts a bond, `selfListVault`s into the index, and runs the proof-bound receipt loop. A 6th agent deployed through it is already live-indexed with on-chain proof-bound receipts.

python -m agents.scripts.verify_proof            # recompute live rationale hashes against chain
API_OUT_DIR=ui/api python -m agents.scripts.guard_snapshot

  PROOFBOUND_FORCE_REASON="forced scenario" \
  API_OUT_DIR=ui/api python -m agents.scripts.proofbound_rebalance
```

`guard_snapshot` and `verify_proof` are read-only. The proof-bound loop runs live receipts and requires a funded operator key in `.env`; use `DRY_RUN=1` before any local experiment.

## Contributing

- Keep deployed addresses in `deployments/` as the source of truth for docs and UI.
- Keep the proof-bound seeded-vault path single-publisher: do not run `receipt_tick` against the same vaults while `proofbound_rebalance` is active.
- Add or update Foundry tests for contract behavior and `sdk/reef.test.js` for SDK call encoding.
- Do not commit generated `__pycache__`, local `broadcast` logs, `.env`, or VPS-only API snapshots.

## Security

Reef is a working prototype that demonstrates the idea end-to-end and live — **not** production-ready. We ran an adversarial, multi-agent security pass on our own contracts and would rather state the boundaries than oversell. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full findings ledger (#1–#29) and [`AI_USAGE.md`](AI_USAGE.md) for how the AI components work.

**Fixed in current source; deployment status varies by immutable contract generation:**

- **Reputation is realized-PnL / donation-proof.** The two ways an agent could fake its own reputation — a self-donation (#15) and a flash-loaned price mark (#13) — are closed: reputation now credits only realized strategy PnL against proportional cost basis (`reputableNav`), and deposits/withdrawals are neutral to reputation per share.
- **ReefGuard can enforce the TrustOracle.** `setTrustPolicy(oracle, minTrustScore)` lets the guard block agents that pass local bond/reputation checks but fail the composite score. `canExecuteAction` also derives size from standard transaction data instead of trusting an agent-supplied bps value.
- **Safe transaction enforcement exists in source.** `ReefSafeGuard` binds a configured Safe to a Reef agent id, blocks delegatecall, computes native/ERC-20 portfolio size from the Safe's balances, and routes the transaction through `canExecuteAction`.
- **Receipts are evidence envelopes in source.** `publishReceipt` now signs decision time, expiry, decision block, action/policy/execution/post-state/outcome hashes, and a content-addressed evidence URI hash.
- **Reputation-writer binding (#21, Critical).** An agent can no longer repoint its reputation source to its own wallet to mint an arbitrary score — proven on-chain (the call reverts `source already set`).

**Open and disclosed (honest boundaries):**

- **Unaudited, and deployed contracts are immutable.** A third-party audit is the prerequisite for any real TVL.
- **Some gaming surface remains.** Receipt _freshness_ is fakeable (inherent to a cheap heartbeat), the reputation component is cohort-relative unless `reputationTarget` is set, and spot-mark share pricing (#28) remains audit-deferred for DEX-marked adapters.
- **The proof is narrow.** A matched proof shows `keccak256(canonical evidence envelope) == on-chain evidenceHash` and separately verifies the rationale hash; it does not attest model identity, prompt integrity, data provenance, or runtime binary integrity.
- **The real-money piece is a tiny proof.** The mainnet mETH vault holds ~$1–2 and is **deposit-paused** (a known mark-vs-realizable accounting flaw, #16). It proves real-RWA custody works; it is not an economically useful vault.
- **Centralized trust points.** The dispute arbiter is already a live **2-of-3 `ArbiterCouncil`** on testnet (the M-of-N slash mechanism is proven on-chain; members are our keys here, independent parties in production). The rate keeper and most governance remain single EOAs (rotatable to a multisig; a 2-of-3 Safe is committed pre-mainnet). The live system runs on one server with ~10-min snapshot freshness.
- **The live AI is intermittent.** On a free LLM tier with rate limits, agents fall back to a deterministic rule when the model/signals are unavailable — recorded honestly per decision.
- **No economic model or cross-chain reputation yet.** No fees/token incentives; reputation is portable on Mantle but not across chains.

## Roadmap

See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Near-term: third-party audit, Safe/ERC-4337 non-bypassable wallet integration, durable evidence storage, timed receipt envelopes, manipulation-resistant share pricing (#28), 2-of-3 Safe governance, and independent agent/framework integrations.
